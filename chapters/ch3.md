## Introduction

Contentious policy debates often center around vague goals that policies should seek to achieve. "Sustainable agriculture" is a quintessential example. The phrase is nebulous, encompasses a variety biophysical and socioeconomic goals, and includes stakeholder groups with different priorities and conceptualizations about how the system works [@ohmart_view_2011; @santiago-brown_what_2015; @toman_difficulty_2010]. In order to move policy discussions forward, it is important to understand what stakeholders' goals for sustainable agriculture are and how they think the goals can be achieved, and it is also important to understand differences in goals and strategies across stakeholder groups. One way to examine what stakeholders think about a system is by studying their mental models. @north_institutions_1990 emphasized that in order to understand institutional change it is essential to understand individuals' mental representations of systems, and @ostrom_understanding_2005 highlighted the importance of mental models in collective action. Indeed, stakeholders' mental models are one of the key variables in Ostrom's framework for understanding social-ecological systems [@ostrom_general_2009].

Here we analyze experts' mental models of sustainable agriculture to get a better understanding of what they think is important and how their perspectives vary. We use cognitive maps to capture the experts' mental models, which allows us to aggregate the models of multiple experts into an integrated representation of their knowledge. Aggregating all of the experts' models into one yields a single model that reflects their combined understanding and can be used by policy makers to identify priorities for sustainable agriculture and causal pathways to effectively support goals. Aggregating models at the regional level provides a spatially resolved snapshot of goals and the strategies seen as effective to achieving the goals. Finally, the cognitive map formulation provides a detailed view of how important each expert thinks each aspect of the system is. We use network analysis tools to examine what types of aspects of the system are widely seen as relevant to and important for sustainable agriculture. 

A cognitive map is a codified representation of an individual or group's mental model of a system as a network of concepts and the causal relationships between them [@axelrod_structure_1976]. They have proved useful as a way to investigate how stakeholders think about complex social ecological systems such as sustainable agriculture [@vanwindekens_new_2014; @kacprzyk_using_2010; @ozesmi_ecological_2004; @gray_modeling_2012]. Their utility derives in part from their ability to represent complex, multifaceted systems as a set of bilateral relationships: A cognitive map consists of the concepts perceived to be important to the system and, for each pair of concepts, the perceived causal relationship between them. Additionally, the network representation of the system is analytically tractable, enabling qualitative analysis [@vanwindekens_new_2014; @santiago-brown_what_2015], systems dynamics simulations [@taber_knowledge_1991; @papageorgiou_using_2012; @ozesmi_participatory_2003], and network analysis [@eden_analysis_1992; @gray_fuzzy_2014]. Indeed, a cognitive map can been seen as a hybrid qualitative/quantitative structure that incorporates the richness of description of qualitative methods with the analytical leverage of quantitative analysis [@dambacher_qualitative_2003; @kacprzyk_using_2010; @jetter_fuzzy_2014].

We elicited cognitive maps of sustainable agriculture from 148 experts from eight regions in California. California is the leading agricultural producer in the United States [@usda_ers_farm_2017] and has a long history of leading knowledge and practices in sustainable agriculture [@lubell_extension_2014; @ohmart_view_2011]. The regions were selected to represent the diversity of biophysical and socioeconomic conditions in California and ranged from desert regions with low average income in the south to wine country on the periphery of the San Francisco Bay Area in the north. For each region we partnered with a local cooperative extension advisor who helped us identify several dozen local thought leaders in sustainable agriculture, whom we then recruited to workshops where we elicited their cognitive maps. Participants included farm advisors, certified pest control advisors, trade group representatives, environmentalists, regulators, and growers. 

Sustainable agriculture is an attractive domain in which to study how experts think about a system for multiple reasons. It is inherently complex, lying at the intersection of multiple other complex systems such as global climate change and economic markets [@meinke_adaptation_2009; @niles_perceptions_2013]. It touches nearly the entire global population, and both the sustainability *of* agriculture, and sustainability *in the face of* agriculture are critical. It features competing stakeholder groups and narratives and is often politically contentious (e.g. debates around genetically engineered crops and the U.S. Farm Bill). However, the policy debates around sustainable agriculture often suffer from ambiguity in language. "Sustainability" itself has been criticized as a being able to mean so many different things that it loses coherent meaning. We propose that investigating experts' mental models of sustainable agriculture can help bring coherence and precision to these debates. Furthermore, in a system so complex and multifaceted as sustainable agriculture, no individual can realistically develop expertise in all aspects of the system [@lubell_extension_2014]. Therefore a mechanism to integrate the understanding of multiple experts is needed, and cognitive maps provide an opportunity to do that.

### Expectations & Hypotheses

A major motivation for this data collection and analysis effort was to present to the research and policy-making communities a single model that integrates the understanding of a large number of experts on sustainable agriculture. This is an inherently descriptive undertaking about which we do not formulate specific hypotheses, but we do have some more general expectations. First, we expect that the most central concepts in the overall aggregate model will represent broad goals reflecting the three "pillars of sustainability" (environmental, social, and economic), with a greater number and diversity of strategies on the periphery of the map. This expectation stems from the previous finding that agricultural goals tend to be more general and shared while causes tend to be more specific and individualized [@hoffman_linking_2014]. 

Our second expectation is at the regional rather than state level and derives from the observation that mental models are likely to be oriented to the current challenges being faced. When one is searching for concepts to include in a model, the most easily available concepts are likely to be mixed in with the most important concepts, and the challenges one is working on in their day-to-day work are likely to be the most easily available [@tversky_availability:_1973; @kahneman_thinking_2011]. Therefore, we expect that aspects of sustainable agriculture related to current challenges within a region will be more central in that region than in the rest of the state. 

Conceptualizing cognitive maps as networks allows us to use network tools to measure a concept's overall centrality in a map (the total number of connections it has) and to what extent a concept is a driver of the system or an endpoint of the system (the ratio of incoming- to outgoing-ties, roughly, "driverness"). We expect the most central concepts in individuals' maps to be those that are present in the most maps, both because those concepts will be active in the various communication channels involved in agriculture [@lubell_extension_2014] and so will be most readily available, and because we expect a shared recognition of what the important aspects of sustainability are. That is, we expect concepts that are widely seen as relevant to sustainable agriculture to be central in individuals' mental models. **Hypothesis 1**: Average centrality of a concept will be positively associated with the number of maps in which it appears. 

We also expect the most central concepts to be more effects than causes. This relates to our second expectation above and stems from the findings that goals tend to be shared across regions [@hoffman_linking_2014], and that multiple causes of a single effect is an extremely common causal motif in these mental models [@levy_structure_2017]. **Hypothesis 2**: Concepts' average centrality will be negatively related to average driverness.

In addition to the tendency for concepts that are more central *on average* to be more effects than causes *on average*, we expect that when the same concept is used by different people, the more centrally it is used, the more of an effect it will be. This stems from the idea that mental models tend to be hierarchical structures with strategies surrounding and scaffolded by central goals [@trope_construal-level_2010]. Thus, whatever an individual perceives to be a goal for the system, it will tend to be central in that individual's mental model. **Hypothesis 3**: When a concept is used in a more central position, it will tend to be more of an effect, and when it is used in a more peripheral position, it will tend to be more of a driver of the system.

## Methods



Mental models of sustainable agriculture were elicited from 148 local thought leaders in eight agricultural regions of California: Merced, Plumas/Sierra, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, Sonoma, Ventura, and Yolo Counties. In each region, we partnered with a local cooperative extension agent to identify and recruit individuals leading the conversation in the region about sustainable agriculture to a four-hour participatory workshop on sustainable agriculture. The number of participants in a workshop ranged from 12 to 46. The Sacramento workshop was part of the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Joint Strategic Initiatives Conference; all other workshops were standalone events.

At the workshops, the broader research project on sustainable agriculture knowledge was described and then participants introduced themselves to each other. Cognitive maps were presented as a way to represent the relational structure of knowledge, and the Mental Modeler software [@gray_mental_2013] they would use to build their maps was demonstrated. Before the modeling exercise, participants completed a brief survey about their professional experience. The survey concluded by asking them to write a few sentences defining what sustainable agriculture means to them, in order to active the relevant knowledge domain their minds [@jetter_fuzzy_2014]. Each participant then worked independently on a Chromebook computer using the Mental Modeler platform to encode their mental model of sustainable agriculture as a cognitive map. The workshop facilitator was present throughout to answer questions and troubleshoot. The exercise continued until all participants had finished adding components to their models, usually around 45 minutes. 

A cognitive map represents a system as a set of concepts and the causal links between them. It is a network representation of a mental model in which nodes can be any aspect of the system and edges represent causal influence between two aspects [@axelrod_structure_1976]. Edges are directed, and in general edges can be valued and/or signed, but we only examined the presence or absence of edges between concepts. Subjects labeled concepts in natural language, and labels ranged in length from 1 to 29 words and included acronyms, colloquialisms, and misspellings. In total, the participants nominated 3,061 concepts, 2,415 of them unique. 

### Concept Synonymy

To enable analyses of the content of the maps, we needed to identify cases of synonymy: where different labels were used to refer to the same underlying concept. In the simplest cases, this involves expanding acronyms or correcting misspellings, but individuals regularly used different terms to refer to the same concept; for example, "atmospheric pollution" and "poor air quality". Of course, there is no definitive boundary between labels referring to the same or different concepts. For example, do "greater nutrient cycling" and "use of animal manure and crop residue" refer to the same concept? How about "ag land" and "identify areas best suited for farming which has natural resources and encourage policy makers to protect these"? 

Before asking whether two labels refer to the same concept, we sought to answer the question, how similar are a pair concepts? Measuring semantic similarity allows us to set arbitrary thresholds for two concepts to be deemed the same, and by adjusting the threshold we can consolidate the 2,415 concepts into any smaller number. However, evaluating the similarity of all pairs would involve 2,914,905 comparisons, and even if it were logistically feasible, having an individual do so would embed the assessor's perspective on relationships of aspects of sustainable agriculture. Therefore, we sought a computational solution. 

Algorithms to assess the semantic similarity of documents have received a lot of attention in recent decades [@sebastiani_machine_2002]; however, these require longer documents than even the longest of our concepts. There also exist myriad methods to assess the semantic similarity of words or short n-grams (tokens), including the Google Similarity Distance of @cilibrasi_google_2004, which proposes that tokens which appear together more frequently, and separately less frequently, on webpages indexed by Google's search engine are more closely related. However, tools for assessing the similarity of tokens require that each token appears in some corpus, while many of our participants' longer concept labels are likely unique utterances. These tools also do not work well with tokens of disparate length. We therefore developed a new method to assess semantic similarity that copes well with concepts' widely varying length, misspellings, and colloquialisms.

### Building a Document for Each Concept

Like @cilibrasi_google_2004, we used Google's database of the web to characterize concepts.
For each concept, we construct a bag of words from its search results page, which allows us to use established document comparison methods on a concept's search results page. To ensure the appropriate context, each concept was appended with the word "agriculture" for its search. We excluded portable document files (PDFs) from the results because their text summaries were often unusable. Searches were made programmatically using the `RCurl` package for R [@temple_lang_rcurl:_2016]. Personalization was turned off, and we issued the requests from Davis, California, February 17-18, 2016. We used the first 100 results for each concept. As an example, for the concept "labor availability", the URL query sent to Google was: "http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=labor+availability+agriculture+-filetype:pdf&btnG=Search&pws=0". 

Results pages for each concept were processed using XPath via the `XML` package for R [@temple_lang_xml:_2016]. Three aspects of each search result were used: Page titles and URLs as the XML values and attributes, respectively, captured via the XPath query `//h3[@class = "r"]/a`, and page summaries as the XML values captured by the query `//span[@class = "_Tgc" or @class = "st"]`. URLs were trimmed to the top-level domain (TLD), which was represented as a single token. Dates were removed from page summaries because summaries often begin with the date of the last update to the page, which we deemed irrelevant. Words present in the original concept were removed from page summaries because the summaries tend to be extremely rich in these words, leading to an overwhelming tendency to cluster concepts that shared words. Uninformative words, defined by the SMART information retrieval system stopword list [@salton_term-weighting_1988], were removed from page titles and summaries. Words in titles and summaries were stemmed to join different parts of speech, plural and singular forms, etc. using the Snowball algorithm [@Porter:1997:ASS:275537.275705] as implemented in the `tm` package for R [@JSSv025i05].

### Concept Consolidation

After processing, each concept's first 100 results' TLDs, page titles, and page summaries were used to generate a bag of words, which were used as documents to construct a document-term matrix (DTM) to cluster the concepts. The dimensions of the DTM were 2,415 rows, one for each unique concept, by 133,779 columns, representing each unique term appearing in the search results. Terms that appeared in fewer than 10% of the rows were removed both to ease computation and to focus the clustering on vocabulary that was shared across concepts. This left 1,748 terms in the DTM, which was then row-normalized. 

We consolidated the concepts into various numbers of clusters using k-means clustering in Euclidean space with one dimension for each term, and each concept extending in each dimension the normalized count of that term. We used the `biganalytics` package [@emerson_biganalytics:_2016] to perform k-means clustering with 5 random cluster-center starting positions and up to 50 iterations for each round of clustering to ensure convergence, keeping the clustering that minimized the sum of squares distances from the points to the cluster centers. Rather than choosing a single number of clusters for our analyses, we retained various numbers of clusters to examine how the level of concept consolidation affects patterns of how individuals and groups think about the system. We examined numbers of cluster as small as 4 and as large as 1,024; here we present results for 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 clusters. The number of concepts assigned to each cluster are presented in [supplementary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ronwgzjrl2cqs8i/ch3_supplement.pdf?dl=0) Figure 3.S1.

Each cluster was assigned a label consisting of the words most over-represented in the search results for the concepts in the cluster. This was done by creating a new DTM, with a document for each cluster, formed by combining the bags of words from the processed search results for each concept in the cluster. For this DTM, only the page titles and summaries were used and words in the original concept were not removed from the summaries. This DTM was filtered to terms occurring in at least 5% of the (original) concepts' search results. The DTM was then term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighted [@karen_sparck_jones_statistical_1972], and the terms with the greatest tf-idf values for each cluster were used as its label. Stemmed terms were "unstemmed" to the form most commonly used in the participants' concepts. The complete set of original concepts, their cluster assignments at the various levels of consolidation, and the tf-idf labels assigned to the clusters are available as [supplementary material](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e3g191a7k2l9nv2/AAAsCohcK2an63hPnzLnZ87Xa?dl=0).

We then consolidated the original concepts into those generated by the clustering procedure. Within each participant's map, concepts were relabeled as the consolidated concepts. If a consolidated concept appeared multiple times in a map, they were merged and their edges summed; self-ties generated in this process were retained. At the end of the consolidation process, each of the 148 participants' maps consisted of a subset of the same concepts, connected by valued edges that indicate the number of directed effects one concept exerts on another. 

### Map Aggregation

With all of the maps consisting of the same nodes, we then aggregated the individuals' maps to the regional and state levels to capture groups' representations of the system. Aggregation proceeded as in the within-map consolidation process: All multiply occurring concepts in maps within a region were merged and their edges summed; the eight regional maps were likewise aggregated to yield a state-wide cognitive map of sustainable agriculture. 

### Map Analysis

To investigate which aspects of sustainable agriculture are perceived as particularly important and unimportant in each region, we compared the centrality of each concept in each regional map to the state map. We calculated the fraction of all ties incident (in either direction) on each concept in each map and took the fraction in the regional map minus the fraction in the state map as a measure of regional emphasis. 

To examine the relationship between concept centrality, whether the concept is more of a cause or effect, and how many people include the concept in their models, we calculated several concept-level variables: 

- Mean centrality: Average total degree---count of incoming and outgoing ties---of a concept in the maps in which it appears. Maps in which a concept does not appear do not contribute a zero to the average.

- Number of maps: The number of maps, out of the 148 individual or eight regional maps, in which the concept appears.

- Driverness: A measure of the balance of outgoing to incoming ties. High driverness indicates a concept that affects many others but is not itself affected strongly by others -- a cause or means to other ends. Low driverness indicates a concept that is influenced by many others -- an effect or goal. Driverness is calculated as the inverse-logit of the base-2 logarithm of the ratio of incoming to outgoing ties. This makes the measure bounded by zero and one and symmetrical around 0.5. The logistic function was used to handle concepts with no incoming or outgoing ties; isolates were assigned a driverness of 0.5.

Additionally, in modeling mean concept centrality, we included the level of concept consolidation as a predictor, as well as its interaction with number of maps, since the number of maps a concept appears in is highly dependent on the level of consolidation. Model comparison with the Bayesian information criterion supported inclusion of an interaction effect for level of consolidation and number of maps but not mean driverness, and not number of maps $\times$ mean driverness. Level of consolidation is instantiated as the logarithm of the inverse of the number of concepts. In this regression all predictors and the response are scaled to have unit standard deviation. The unit of observation is a concept within a level of consolidation, averaged across individuals, yielding 630 observations.

We also regress concept centrality on driverness with each use of the concept as an observation, obtaining a separate regression fit for each concept. Here, there is no averaging across individuals; the unit of analysis is a concept in an individual map. Thus, the number of observations varies by concept and is equal to the number of individuals that included that concept in their map. In these regressions, we examine the distribution of estimates across concepts. These are fixed-effects estimates for each concept within each level of consolidation. Centrality is the base-10 logarithm of the total degree of the concept and neither variable is scaled. Isolates, which represent 46 of the 11,456 observations, are not considered in this analysis. These slope estimates address how a concept's driverness changes when the concept is more used more centrally or peripherally by an individual.

### Software

Cognitive maps were elicited using the online version of Mental Modeler [@gray_mental_2013]. Mental Modeler files are stored as XML, which was parsed into network edgelists in R. All analyses were performed in R version 3.3.3 [@r_core_team_r:_2017]. In addition to the packages cited above, we used the `tidyverse` suite of packages for tabular data manipulation and visualization [@wickham_tidyverse:_2017], and `netUtils` and the `statnet` suite of packages for network data manipulation and visualization [@levy_netutils:_2017; @handcock_statnet:_2016; @handcock_statnet:_2008]. The `stargazer` package was used to present model results tables [@hlavac_stargazer:_2015], and this manuscript was written in RMarkdown and compiled with `knitr` [@allaire_rmarkdown:_2017; @xie_knitr:_2017; @stodden_knitr:_2014].

## Results

Figure 3.1 presents the statewide aggregated map consolidated to 40 concepts. Regional and state maps at various levels of consolidation are presented as [supplemental material](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s018xrbq8yfivjj/AABI7Zn6cgesdmje59qo0z7Da?dl=0). The concept labeled *viability, goals, equity, sustainable* is by far the most central, and it is much more of an effect than a cause (driverness = 0.14). It includes original concepts that articulate goals in each of the "three Es" of sustainability: environmental, economic, and equity (social); for example, "economic viability" and "wildlife sustainability", and it also incorporates higher-level thinking about goals for sustainable agriculture, such as "consensus on sustainability meaning and goals". In the periphery of the map, there seem to be thematic clusters around community support and knowledge, economics and labor, and inputs and pest management. The most central drivers in the map are *educated, teacher, career, ffa* and *pesticide, regulate, regulatory, license*, reflecting the perception that education and regulations are important forces on the system. Overall, the picture is of broad, central goals with many mechanisms to influence those goals in the periphery, consistent with our first expectation.

### Regional emphases

The eight regions in which we conducted elicitation workshops represent the diversity of biophysical and socioeconomic conditions found in California agriculture. To investigate differences in what the thought leaders in these regions perceive the most important aspects of sustainable agriculture to be, we compared the centrality of each concept in each region to the statewide map. Figure 3.2 presents the 3 most over- and under-emphasized concepts (with emphasis as the fraction of all ties in the map incident on a concept) in each region relative to the rest of the state, again at the 40-concept consolidation level.

In general, concept emphasis parallels the physical and social conditions of the regions. San Diego has some of the most expensive water in the country and *water, groundwater, pollutant, irrigation* is emphasized there. Sacramento is near the statewide consensus for all concepts, as one might expect and hope for in a state capital. Yolo County is home to a top agricultural university and the University of California's Agriculture and Natural Resources division, and its regional map is less concerned with the broad goals of *viability, goals, equity, sustainable* and more concerned with specific approaches to pest control and soil management. Sonoma---where high-value wine production and proximity to San Francisco make land expensive---highlights labor costs and profitability for beginning and family farmers. Plumas is a mountainous region, and its map emphasizes infrastructure and ranching viability. This is consistent with our second expectation, that local challenges in each region would appear in more central positions in the mental models of people from that region. 

![Most over- and under-emphasized concepts in each regional map relative to statewide map (fraction of ties attached to a concept in the regional map minus the fraction in the state map).

The under- and over-emphasized tick marks on the horizontal axes represent a difference from the state map of five percentage points.](figure/regional emphasis plot-1.png)

### Central concepts are effects that are widely perceived

People tend to place concepts that many people are thinking about at the center of their maps, while concepts in the periphery of maps are likely to be less-widely perceived as relevant to sustainable agriculture (Figure 3.3; Table 3.1). This supports our first hypothesis and reflects a general consensus about what is important in sustainable agriculture -- if the regression lines in Figure 3.3 were flat or downward sloping, it would indicate that at the center of some people's maps are concepts that others are not thinking about at all.

This effect is stronger at greater levels of consolidation where there are fewer concepts and each encompasses more of the system (Table 3.1, interaction term). As concepts are consolidated, they naturally appear in a greater fraction of maps, and it tends to be the disparate causes that consolidate later in the process. That is, initially the broad goals that are widely shared group together, but the more idiosyncratic causes remain separate---with low centrality and in few maps---leading to the modest slope in the first panels of Figure 3.3A. As those peripheral concepts eventually group together, their average centrality remains low, but the number of maps they appear in increases, leading to the steeper slopes at greater levels of consolidation.

In addition to more widely perceived concepts being in the center of maps, concepts that are perceived to be more effects than causes are also more central. That is, after controlling for the number of individuals that perceive a concept to be involved in sustainable agriculture, concepts that are perceived to be more endpoints for the system rather than drivers of the system appear in the center of maps. It is worth noting that the average driverness of a concept is also weakly correlated with the number of maps in which it appears ($\rho = -0.11$) -- effects tend to be included in more maps than drivers. All of these measures are averaged over individuals' uses of a concept; in the next subsection we turn to how concepts are differentially used across maps.

### Cognitive tendency to place effects centrally




The above analyses have examined concepts' central tendencies across maps; here we turn to how the same concepts are used differently across individuals. Figure 3.4 presents OLS slopes for regressions of concept driverness versus centrality. Each line represents a concept and has as its unit of observation all of the maps that included the concept. Thus, a downward sloping line indicate a concept that, when used more centrally is more of an effect, and when used more peripherally is more of a driver. Supporting our third hypothesis, this is the case for the vast majority of concepts: When different people think about the same concept, the more they see it as an endpoint for the system, the more central they perceive it to be, and the more they see it as a driver of the system and the less central it will be.

This pattern holds across levels of concept consolidation. Figure 3.5 presents the distributions of centrality versus driverness slopes. Across levels of consolidation, the median slope is quite consistent, ranging from -0.37 to -0.32, and the fraction of concepts having negative slopes ranges from 81% at 320 concepts to 100% at 10 concepts. Thus, even when concepts are consolidated to very general, overarching themes, where they appear more centrally they are more effect and less cause.

## Discussion

We have presented a causal model of sustainable agriculture that integrates 148 experts' understanding. The model can be inspected to identify shared goals for sustainable agriculture and the means perceived to be effective to achieve them, and network analysis and systems dynamics tools can be used to interrogate the model more deeply. We compared the maps of eight regions to identify aspects of sustainable agriculture each region perceives to be particularly important. Statistical models revealed that concepts regarded as central to sustainable agriculture tend to be goals that many people see as relevant components of the system.

Figure 3.1 presents a single model that reflects the aggregate perspective of 148 sustainable agriculture thought leaders from a wide range of professions and regions across California. The individuals who contributed to the model were selected to be those who are in contact with and deliver usable knowledge to growers. It can therefore be used by policy makers to identify shared goals for sustainable agriculture across communities in California. We found big, general goals at the center of the map incorporating aspects of all three pillars of sustainability. Thematic clusters of strategies surround those goals, involving irrigation, economics, labor, regulations, community, education, farmland, pest management, inputs, and climate adaptation. Secondary, more specific goals included healthy food affordability; community resilience and well-being; living wages and poverty reduction; profitability for small, beginning, and family farms; feeding a growing population; integrated pest management; and climate change mitigation. 

As a tool for policy makers and managers, this map goes far beyond highlighting what thought leaders think is important in sustainable agriculture. It also reveals what strategies the community of experts thinks will be effective to accomplish any particular goal. The first step in this direction would be to examine the strongest direct causes of a goal; for example, if one's interest is in promoting the goals incorporated in *wage, labor, worker, minimum*, one should look at which concepts have the most ties to that concept in the model, the first of which is *perception, infrastructure, media, flexible* in this case. To enable these types of analyses, we provide the model presented in Figure 3.1 as a generic [comma-separated value adjacency matrix](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zwtjkank0zqtx60/AAAnHcHuisaTc5xlq0uGODLBa?dl=0) for each of the consolidation levels. In an adjacency matrix, the entry in row $i$, column $j$ indicates the strength of causal influence from concept $i$ to concept $j$. This data also enables simulations and scenarios, leveraging the power of the network structure of a cognitive map to understand how indirect effects contribute to or detract from goals. Those interested in pursuing such an analysis would benefit from consulting @ozesmi_ecological_2004, @papageorgiou_using_2012, and the documentation of the Mental Modeler software [@gray_mental_2013].

We found substantial differences in the aggregated group mental models from the eight regions where we held workshops (Figure 3.2). Consistent with our expectation, these differences highlighted the specific challenges each region faces, such as water in Southern California, expenses near the Bay Area, and infrastructure and community in the mountains. Refreshingly, the state capital workshop aligned closely with the statewide consensus map. Notably, challenges that by nature spill across regions---particularly climate change mitigation---were not only not highlighted in any particular region, but barely appeared in the mental models. There were several climate change adaptation concepts present, but the only concept focused on climate change mitigation, *emissions, greenhouse, gas, carbon*, had just 0.2% of all connections in the model. Perhaps the old adage to "think locally and act globally" could use revision in light of our global challenges. 

Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1 show that the concepts people perceive as highly central to sustainable agriculture are widely recognized as involved in sustainable agriculture. This is reassuring, but not tautological. It could have been the case that concepts agreed to be relevant to sustainable agriculture are only peripherally important while the concepts some think are important (central) others think are irrelevant (absent from mental models). The widespread recognition of the relevance of the most central concepts in sustainable agriculture should facilitate dialog and provide common ground. It could be the result of common perception and understanding of what is important. It could also derive from social learning such as conformity or prestige bias [@richerson_cultural_2013], for example that the more people one hears talking about a concept, the more important one takes that concept to be. 

Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1 also show that concepts widely perceived as central tend to be endpoints rather than drivers of the system. This aligns with previous findings that farmers have hierarchically organized mental models of sustainability, with broad, shared goals anchoring specific, idiosyncratic strategies (causes) for the goals [@hoffman_linking_2014]. It implies that while it may be easier to achieve consensus on what policy goals ought to be, individuals are likely to hold differing opinions on what means will be effective to reach the goals. This is true among regional maps as well, where the relationship between centrality and driverness is also significantly negative (Table 3.S1), suggesting that an intermediate step such as representatives from stakeholder groups brought together to represent their constituencies may be of little help in facilitating consensus on what effective strategies can be used to reach goals.

As concepts are consolidated into broader categories, the slope of the relationship between centrality and number of maps including a concept steepens (Table 3.1, interaction effect). This is consistent with the above postulated mechanisms and reflects the fact that the consolidation process first groups together central concepts that are in many maps. These are goals for sustainable agriculture that enjoy widespread agreement. Naturally, Google search results for these concepts tend to be quite similar, precisely because they are widely understood. As a result, they merge at lower levels of consolidation. In contrast, strategies to achieve sustainable agriculture goals are more disparate. Google search results for these concepts return a wider variety of text, so these concepts only merge at high levels of consolidation. When they do finally merge, it leads to a greater number of maps sharing concepts with low average centrality, which yields the steeper slope seen at higher levels of consolidation. 

Finally, we also examined how people differently use the same concepts in their mental models. In the previous analysis, both centrality and driverness were averaged over individuals' uses, so they have captured the consensus view about the concepts. But within those averages there is variance and that variance reveals something about the way people construct their mental models. When a person thinks of a concept as more of an effect, it tends to be more central, and when someone else thinks about the same concept, but thinks about it as more of a driver, it tends to be more peripheral (Figures 4 & 5). It seems that goals for the system likely serve as cognitive access points: When a knowledge domain is activated, the first thing to come up is goals for the system, which then have multiple causes attached to them. This is consistent with our previous finding that the motif of multiple causes of a single effect is almost universally over-represented relative to chance in these mental models, while the motif of multiple effects of a single causes is more rare [@levy_structure_2017].  

Overall, there are three take-home messages from this paper. One is that internet search results can productively be used to construct a corpus from arbitrary syntactic entities to enable semantic analysis. Another is that cognitive maps can be combined across individuals and groups to produce a useful aggregation of knowledge. Finally, there is widespread agreement on the most central concepts involved in sustainable agriculture, which tend to be goals, while there is more heterogeneity across peripheral strategies to achieve those goals.
