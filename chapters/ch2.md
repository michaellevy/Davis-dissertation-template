This paper elicits and analyzes the mental models of sustainable agriculture of 148 agricultural outreach and extension professionals in California. A mental model is the representation in the mind of a system in the world [@forrester_counterintuitive_1971], which explicitly recognizes causal relationships between system components [@axelrod_structure_1976]. Mental models can be portrayed as "cognitive maps", which are networks where nodes are different concepts and a directed link between two concepts is a perceived causal relationship [@gray_fuzzy_2014]. We draw on network theory to identify motifs within cognitive maps that represent different notions of causality in complex systems. We then compare individuals to identify the extent to which their cognitive maps embody "systems thinking", whether the extent of systems thinking varies according to individual attributes related to expertise, and how the micro-level motifs are associated with different macro-level attributes of cognitive maps relevant to decision-making.

Our research is motivated by two important aspects of the discourse and science about sustainability. First, sustainability concepts are usually applied to complex systems with interdependencies across multiple scales [@cash_scale_2006]. For example, sustainable agriculture involves social and biophysical aspects of the food system, cooperation and conflict among stakeholder groups, consideration of multiple normative goals, and the management of knowledge networks [@cash_knowledge_2003; @lubell_extension_2014]. As a result, individual's definitions of sustainability vary and are often vague, which precipitates considerable debate among academics and policy-makers. Sustainability is often criticized as an elastic concept that depends on the eye of the beholder, which makes it difficult to resolve conflict and measure progress. Our research takes a different tack by arguing that in order to resolve these debates, we must first understand how people think about sustainability.

Second, the recognition of such complexity and interdependence has led to widespread calls for systems thinking to improve decision-making in sustainable agriculture [@shiyomi_utilization_2001], environmental issues [@metzcontribution; @rothman_growing_1997; @hawken_natural_1999; @bosch_getting_2007] and the management of complex systems generally [@meadows_thinking_2008; @schvaneveldt_measuring_1985]. Meinke *et al.* articulate what it means to think in systems:
 
> Systems thinking places as much importance on understanding dynamic interactions between parts as it does on understanding the functions of the parts themselves. The system(s) of interest (and its/their outputs) need(s) to be viewed and evaluated holistically, including the key linkages and interactions between system components.[@meinke_adaptation_2009]

Our approach theorizes about the cognitive basis of systems thinking and empirically analyzes how it varies across individuals. A central theme is that it is harder for people to think about more complicated forms of causality, and the extent to which they do has important implications for individual and collective decision-making about sustainability.

In addition to its importance for environmental, economic, and social issues, sustainable agriculture is an excellent research topic because it is an interdisciplinary concept that applies to inherently complex systems. California is the most agriculturally productive state in the United States [@usda_ers_farm_2017], and it has a long history as a leader in sustainable agriculture knowledge and practices  [@lubell_extension_2014; @ohmart_view_2011]. We study agricultural outreach and extension professionals in California who were identified as thought leaders in sustainable agriculture. Studying these types of individuals is important because of their experience and responsibilities for extending knowledge about sustainable agriculture.

### Systems thinking: Simple and complex causality

A number of different research fields have examined systems-thinking, including social and cognitive psychology [@rouse_looking_1986; @white_anthropomorphic_1992; @mathieu_influence_2000], education [@allison_cognitive_1996; @grotzer_taxonomy_2000; @slotta_helping_2006], organizational behavior [@eden_nature_1992; @bueno_benchmarking_2009], political science [@axelrod_structure_1976; @richards_coordination_2001; @lakoff_whose_2006], and engineering [@dickerson_virtual_1994; @stylios_fuzzy_1999; @jetter_fuzzy_2014]. A broad hypothesis across these fields is that it is cognitively difficult to include more complex forms of causality in mental models [@meadows_thinking_2008]. This hypothesis encompasses how people conceptualize the number of components in the systems and the causal relationships among them. 

Typically the first analysis of a mental model asks how many components are considered and are they causes or effects in the system? Construal level theory [@trope_construal-level_2010] suggests that effects (i.e. goals) are more psychologically distant and more abstractly construed, than their causes (i.e. means), which are represented more concretely. The implication for systems thinking is that there will be fewer goals or effects because they are more generalized, with many specific causes influencing the goals. For example, in California winegrowers' mental models, goals are more abstract, rare, and generalized, while strategies to reach the goals are more specific, numerous, and idiosyncratic [@hoffman_linking_2014]. 

Once the components of the system are identified, the next question is whether the structural relationships among them indicate simple versus complex causal thinking. For example, a simple causal relationship might be that technology adoption increases farm yields, while a more complex relationship might be that while technology adoption directly increases yields, it also generates externalities which can degrade water quality, which may lead to regulations that reduce farm profitability. Research suggests the ability to comprehend complex causal effects develops with age [@grotzer_childrens_1993], and training students in causal thinking may improve their ability to articulate complex causal ideas [@bell-basca_using_2000; @grotzer_taxonomy_2000]. People commonly underestimate the propagation of indirect effects, such as the extent to which perturbations to a food web dampen as they propagate through a system  [@white_naive_1997]. Jaques' stratified systems theory argues that only after prolonged experience with a system do individuals gain perception of complex causality [@jaques_development_1986]. In engineering, the call for additional training in systems thinking reflects the difficulty in going beyond simple causal models [@langan-fox_analyzing_2001; @leveson_engineering_2011; @davis_advancing_2014]. Taken together, the broad range of research on systems thinking suggests mental models are typically characterized by hierarchical structure with few goals and multiple causes, connected mostly by simple rather than complex causal ideas. 

### Cognitive maps: A network approach to systems thinking

Mental models can be represented as cognitive maps [@axelrod_structure_1976] that depict a system as a network in which nodes represent concepts and edges represent directed causal effects. The concepts can include any ideas that an individual (or group) considers components of the system; they might may be physical quantities such as groundwater levels, social concepts such as crop subsidies, or normative goals such as social justice. 

The network instantiation of cognitive maps allows us to conceptualize the fundamental building blocks of networks---network motifs---as representing different types of causality. A network motif is a small number of nodes, typically two or three, with a particular minimal set of connections. They are useful because they are sufficiently simple to be substantively interpretable at the micro-level, and comparing their count in a network to an expectation provides insight about the extent to which an observed cognitive map contains motifs representing different micro-level processes[@faust_comparing_2002; @lusher_exponential_2012]. Table 2.1 enumerates six motifs that we argue are relevant for sustainability, their associated causal patterns, their name from the network analysis literature, a related macroscopic network metric that has previously been used in cognitive map analyses, our hypothesized prevalence of the motif in our sustainable agriculture cognitive maps, and a summary of our findings of the prevalence of the motif. For example, in stars reflect two causes exerting influences on a common effect, out stars reflect one cause exerting influence on two effects, and cyclic triples reflect three concepts each both influencing and being influenced by one other, i.e. a feedback loop.

### Hypotheses

We test three hypotheses based on this framework. *Hypothesis 1* focuses on the micro-level of cognitive maps and the relative difficulty of simple versus complex causal thinking. Construal level theory suggests that individuals will be able to articulate fewer effects and more causes [@trope_construal-level_2010], which leads us to expect that multiple causes will be prevalent and multiple effects will be rare. Past research has suggested that indirect and cyclic effects are difficult to identify [@grotzer_childrens_1993; @grotzer_taxonomy_2000; @bell-basca_using_2000; @white_naive_1997], which leads us to expect that indirect effects and feedback loops will be rare in cognitive maps. Because a mediated effect (transitive triple) contains an indirect effect, a multiple cause, and a multiple effect---one of which we expect to be common and the others rare---we have no *a priori* hypothesis about the prevalence of moderated effects.

We analyze the prevalence of each motif using conditional uniform random graph (CUG) tests, which test whether the frequency of motifs observed in a network are significantly different than what would be expected from a random graph in which all possible edges are equally probable [@anderson_interaction_1999; @butts_social_2008]. This approach allows us to compare the frequency of observed motifs across individuals, controlling for number of concepts and connections in the map.<!-- *mike might need an intuitive example here if not in results section* --> Based on the results of the CUG tests, we use cluster analysis to identify three styles of thinking about sustainable agriculture ranging from simple to more complex causality.  

*Hypothesis 2* tests whether years of experience in agriculture and level of formal education achieved are positively associated with richer forms of systems thinking. Our study focuses on agricultural and outreach professionals in California, who are involved in sustainable agriculture programs. Social and cognitive psychology research suggests that education facilitates the identification of more complex causal structures; likewise for professionals as they gain experience with a system [@grotzer_taxonomy_2000; @jaques_development_1986]. We therefore expect individuals with more experience and more education to have cognitive maps that include more of the complex causal structures than individuals with less experience and education. We test these predictions with ordinal logistic regression models that use attributes of education and experience to predict whether an individual's cognitive map falls into a category of less or more complex causal thinking.

*Hypothesis 3* examines the correlation between the micro-level motifs in cognitive maps and the macro-level network statistics that characterize the overall structure of the map and are considered important for systems thinking. First, we analyze a suite of network statistics that reflect various aspects of systems thinking proposed by Eden [@eden_analysis_1992] and subsequently used to analyze cognitive maps of social-ecological systems [@ozesmi_ecological_2004; @gray_fuzzy_2014]. According to this literature, nodes in cognitive maps are divided into three classes: transmitters, which have no incoming edges; receivers, which have no outgoing edges; and ordinary variables, which have incoming and outgoing edges. Cognitive maps with a higher ratio of receiver to transmitter variables (R/T), which encompass multiple goals, are characterized as more complex. Complexity is also measured with a hierarchy index conceptualized by MacDonald [@macdonald_trees_1983] that captures how concentrated causal origins are and has been used to place thinking on a spectrum from fully top-down to fully democratic. We hypothesize that the ratio of receiver to transmitter variables (R/T) will be positively correlated, and map hierarchy will be negatively correlated, with bidirectionality, multiple effects, indirect effects, and feedback loops.

To illustrate how these network statistics have been previously applied, in a case study of participatory management of a lake, municipal personnel had the most complex maps, as indicated by a large R/T, and this fact was used to conclude that they may be useful catalysts for change because they consider many outcomes and implications of the system [@ozesmi_participatory_2003]. Studying stakeholder knowledge in the context of fishery management, scientists' maps included more receiver variables than any other stakeholder group, indicating cognitive complexity and recognition of multiple objectives, while harvesters' maps included the most transmitter variables, suggesting that they see the system as largely exogenously determined [@gray_modeling_2012].

A second suite of global network statistics comes from Krackhardt [@krackhardt_graph_1994], who defined four statistics related to organizational structures: connectedness, efficiency, hierarchy, and least-upper boundedness (LUBedness). Connectedness (weak form) measures the fraction of dyads that have a path between them, regardless of the direction of ties. Efficiency measures how often there are multiple paths between two nodes. Hierarchy measures the fraction of dyads with a connecting path in one direction that do not have a connecting path in the other direction; this is a different measure than MacDonald's [@macdonald_trees_1983] hierarchy. Finally, LUBedness captures the extent to which dyads share an antecedent node, and if they share multiple antecedents, whether those antecedents have a single shared antecedent. In the organizational context, LUBedness reflects unity of command as an "out-tree". In our experience, the archetypal mental model is not an out-tree, but an in-tree, in which there is one ultimate goal for the system and independent causes influencing the central goal. We therefore define greatest-lower boundedness (GLBedness) as the LUBedness of the network with all ties reversed (i.e. the adjacency matrix transposed) to adjust Krackhardt's statistics for comparison to the in-tree archetype.



## Results




Figure 2.1 presents the results of the CUG tests for each of the six structural motifs, for all 148 subjects. A map with a p-value near one has an abundance of that motif relative to chance, and a p-value near zero indicates a dearth of that motif. Each of the six "violins" in Figure 2.1 shows the distribution of the 148 individual maps' p-values for that motif. For example, multiple causes were ubiquitous, being over-represented in 88.5% of the 148 maps. In contrast, feedback loops were the rarest structure relative to chance, being over-represented in only 14.9% of the maps, and being totally absent from 60%. These findings are generally consistent with our first hypothesis for each motif.

Within each structure (x-axis), each point represents one individual's mental model, and is placed by the probability (y-axis) that a uniform random graph of the same size and density will have a lesser count of that statistic than the mental model; thus, probabilities near one indicate an abundance of the structure relative to chance levels. The blue curves reflect the density of points around any probability value.](figure/CUG violins-1.png)

Next, we attempt to define characteristic modes of systems thinking by clustering the cognitive maps based on their use of the various causal motifs. We use hierarchical clustering to group maps with similar CUG test results together. The maps form three distinct clusters (Figure 2.2). The first cluster (terminal nodes colored green) includes cognitive maps that make frequent use of the two most common motifs---multiple causes and moderated effects---and few others. The cognitive maps in cluster 2 (orange) differ from the first cluster primarily in their in their incorporation of multiple effects, but also introduce some anti-hierarchical structure---bidirectional effects or feedback loops---and feature less use of multiple causes. Maps in cluster 3 (purple) are more individualized and incorporate combinations of the rarer motifs of indirect effects, bidirectional effects, and feedback loops. The first principle components separating the maps into these clusters and the loadings of each causal motif onto them are presented in Figure S1.

The colorbars beneath the dendrogram show how over- or under-represented each structure is the cognitive map directly above in the dendrogram.](figure/clust-wardD2-arranged.png)

To test our second hypothesis, that experience and education are associated with richer forms of systems thinking, we consider the three clusters as levels of systems thinking, with increasing complexity from cluster 1 to cluster 3, and ask how well education and experience predict which cluster an individual's map will be in. The posterior probability distribution for an ordinal logistic regression predicting cluster as a function of education and experience is presented in Figure 2.3. Education and experience are both positively associated with systems thinking cluster, and only 3.4% of the posterior probability supports education and experience having no effect or a negative effect on the level of systems thinking. We also conditioned models with each causal motif as the response variable (Figure S2). Overall, while the effects are noisy, individuals with more education and experience tend to include more complex motifs in their cognitive maps.

Figure 2.4 presents correlations relating our CUG test findings to previously used metrics of cognitive maps and network structure. As we hypothesized, R/T was positively correlated with multiple effects and negatively correlated with multiple causes. We did not find strong correlations between R/T and other causal motifs. The hierarchy index employed in the social-ecological systems literature [@ozesmi_ecological_2004; @gray_fuzzy_2014] comes from MacDonald [@macdonald_trees_1983] and is in fact a measure of variance of out-degree. We found this measure to be highly correlated with R/T (Figure S3), and it did not capture additional dimensions of systems thinking as indicated by relationships with the causal motifs. However, there are other definitions of hierarchy in the network analysis literature, and we think the one defined by Krackhardt [@krackhardt_graph_1994]---the fraction of dyads with a path between them in one direction that do not have a path between them in the opposite direction---is an applicable measure of top-down structure in cognitive maps. Consistent with our third hypothesis, we found this measure to be significantly negatively correlated with every causal motif except the most common one, multiple causes. We present the full correlation matrix in Figure S3.

## Discussion

The major contribution of this paper is to develop theory about how different network motifs in cognitive maps relate to simple versus complex systems thinking, and to examine how those motifs vary across individuals and relate to macro-structures. The analysis is motivated by the importance of illuminating the cognitive underpinnings of how people think about sustainable agriculture and complex systems. Here, we offer several conjectures about the implications of our analysis for the debate about the definition of sustainable agriculture, along with individual and collective decision-making around the idea of sustainability. These conjectures can provide the basis for future research questions.  

We found that cognitive maps of sustainable agriculture were rich in multiple causes and moderated effects and poor in bidirectional effects and feedback loops, while multiple and indirect effects were more variable (Figure 2.1). This finding is remarkable because our study participants were deeply involved in sustainable agriculture: The median participant had a master's degree and 20 years of experience in agriculture. Yet even within this highly knowledgeable group, there is a modest positive relationship between education and experience and more complex forms of causal thinking. We suspect that we have not uniformly sampled the full range of systems thinking about sustainable agriculture among agricultural professionals. Eliciting the cognitive maps of individuals less knowledgeable would likely reveal simpler cognitive maps and stronger relationships between education and experience and complexity of systems thinking.  Hence, training in systems thinking [@bell-basca_using_2000] is likely to be important for improving decision-making for sustainability even among people who already subscribe to the idea, and probably even more so for those with less experience or more skepticism regarding sustainability.

At the same time, we found that mental models commonly consider a small number of goals with many causes, and rarely to consider multiple goals with few causes. For collective decision-making where there is broad agreement on the goals, this implies an important role for scientific research in sorting out the evidence for different causal pathways.  On the other hand, where there is broad disagreement about a few goals, collective decisions will be much more conflictual. This is often seen in debates about sustainable agriculture where some stakeholders focus only on economic goals, while others integrate environmental and social goals. When most people in a group consider multiple goals, it may be easier to find some common ground. 

The cluster analysis suggest three broad "styles" of sustainability thinking, that on one end are simple and hierarchical, with few effects and many causes (green cluster). These simple maps are more efficient, with a lack of redundancy in paths among concepts that suggests a pared down view of the system. Mental models characterized by direct, one-directional causation may be advantageous for quick decision making, and where interdependence and feedback is minimal their simplifications may be adaptive. However, in systems where interdependence is significant---such as sustainable agriculture and other complex social-ecological systems---these mental models are likely to fail to perceive consequences of actions, leading to sub-optimal decision making.

The second (orange cluster) and third (purple cluster) styles of system thinking begin to incorporate motifs that represent more complex forms of system thinking. Cluster 2 is differentiated mainly by the introduction of multiple effects, but also sometimes features the anti-hierarchical motifs of bidirectionality and feedback loops. It is only in cluster 3 that indirect effects are extensively represented, but there is also a high diversity of mixing of motifs across individuals. The inclusion of more complex motifs tends to decrease the hierarchy and efficiency of cognitive maps, suggesting that the development of systems thinking proceeds through the perception of multiple pathways of causal effect. Individuals with more complex cognitive maps may be less decisive and take more time to evaluate the consequences of different actions because they must consider more interdependencies among system components. However, they are less likely to overlook effects that ripple throughout the system. 

In a collective decision-making or policy setting, individuals with simple causal maps are likely to quickly come to agreement if the goals and interdependencies in their maps are similar. This may be akin to the formation of advocacy coalitions on the basis of common ideologies [@sabatier_advocacy_1988; @jenkins-smith_evaluating_1994], and the debate over sustainable agriculture is often characterized by sharp cleavages between actors who focus predominantly on economic goals versus those who seek to integrate social and environmental goals [@lubell_extension_2014; @hoffman_linking_2014]. However, if actors with simple but conceptually divergent cognitive maps are placed in the same decision context, conflict is more likely. On the other hand, collective decision-making among people with more complex cognitive maps may take longer to resolve as they debate different aspects of the system, but ultimately may be more likely to find common ground for cooperation. Such predictions could be tested in small group experimental research, by first characterizing each individual's cognitive maps, and then asking them to solve a related collective problem.

Our study advances sustainability science by examining the cognitive underpinnings of systems thinking as applied to sustainable agriculture. Our theoretical framework and empirical results are an important accompaniment to the broad normative debate about sustainability that exists in many areas of science and policy. Our approach will also be relevant to other scientific and policy debates that feature poorly defined, normative concepts applied to complex systems, such as ecosystem health, biosecurity, energy independence, and resilience/adaptive capacity.      

## Methods

### Participant Recruitment and Data Collection

We elicited mental models of sustainable agriculture from 148 experts from eight diverse agricultural regions of California. All activities were approved by the University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board. The experts were identified in collaboration with local cooperative extension agents as the local opinion leaders in sustainable agriculture and the individuals to whom producers look for information. They consisted of representatives from Cooperative Extension, farm bureaus, resource conservation districts, agricultural commissioners and other regulatory agencies, and environmental advocacy organizations, as well as pest control advisors, crop advisors, and community-engaged producers. We targeted this group because they represent the conduit through which diffusion of sustainable agriculture knowledge and practices occurs. Their understanding of agriculture and sustainability is informed by policy makers and scientists, as well as growers and other local stakeholders.

Maps were elicited in workshops held in eight disparate California counties, selected to capture the diversity of both socioeconomic and bioagronomic diversity in the state: Merced, Plumas/Sierra, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, Sonoma, Ventura, and Yolo Counties. Workshops were four hours long and included a brief survey, the elicitation of participants' individual cognitive maps, a group discussion and collective model elicitation process, and a discussion on the use of new media tools in agriculture outreach. The data used here are from the surveys and individual mental models. The survey provided demographic information about the individuals including their education and experience levels, and concluded with a question designed to prime thinking about sustainable agriculture, which enhances map elicitation [@jetter_fuzzy_2014]. Following the survey, participants were given a brief introduction to the research project, cognitive maps, and the particular software they would use to build their models. Instructions were kept to a minimum to avoid biasing participants; instead, they were told to build a model of "the factors involved in sustainable agriculture and how they affect each other". Each person was given a Chromebook laptop computer and used the Mental Modeler platform [@gray_mental_2013] to build their models. The individual modeling continued until all participants had finished adding to their models, which generally took at least 45 minutes. 

### Cognitive Map Analysis

All analyses and visualization were done using R version 3.3.3 [@r_core_team_r:_2017] and the following packages: `statnet` [@handcock_statnet:_2016; @handcock_statnet:_2008], `rethinking` [@mcelreath_rethinking:_2016], `tidyverse` [@wickham_tidyverse:_2017], `netUtils` [@levy_netutils:_2017], `corrplot` [@wei_r_2017] `dendextend` [@galili_dendextend:_2015], and `factoextra` [@kassambara_factoextra:_2017]. Mental Modeler stores maps in XML format; we parsed the XML to represent the networks in R as `statnet` network objects. Causal connections in Mental Modeler can take signs and weights, but for all analyses here edges were only considered present or absent; thus each cognitive map was represented as a digraph. 

For the CUG test analysis we simulated 10,000 networks with the same size and density as each of the cognitive maps and uniform edge probability. For each of the six causal motifs (Table 2.1), the probability the cognitive map had a greater count of the motif than a random graph was taken as the fraction of simulated networks with a lesser count of the motif than the cognitive map [@anderson_interaction_1999; @butts_social_2008]. 

The cognitive maps were hierarchically clustered based on the results of the CUG tests. Each of the six motif's p-values was used as a dimension, and maps were agglomerated into clusters such that each addition minimized the sum of squares Euclidean distances within clusters [@Inchoate:Ward63; @murtagh_wards_2014].

To examine the effect of experience and education on systems thinking, we conditioned a Bayesian ordinal logistic regression model with cluster as the response variable and years of experience in agriculture and highest degree earned as predictors. Education was instantiated as a continuous variable (High school = 1, Bachelor's = 2, Master's = 3, Doctorate = 4), and both predictors were scaled to have unit standard deviation. Priors were minimally informative ($Normal(0, 5)$ for both $\beta$ parameters and the ordinal logit cutpoints). Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via Stan [@stan_development_team_stan:_2015] was used to draw 100,000 samples after a 10,000 sample warmup from the posterior for each of three separate chains. Chains converged and were well mixed, with $\hat{R}$ very near one for all parameters. All 300,000 samples from the joint posterior were used to create Figure 2.3. We also conditioned models with varying intercept terms for the individual's region and/or professional sector (extension, academia, government, industry, agriculture, or ngo), but model comparison with WAIC preferred models without these variables. We also conditioned models with each of the causal motifs' p-values as the response variable, using a beta link function; posterior distributions for these models are presented in supplementary material. 

MacDonald's hierarchy [@macdonald_trees_1983] was calculated as:

$$\dfrac{12}{(N-1)N(N+1)} \sum\limits_i{(od_i - \overline{od})^2}$$

where $od_i$ is the out-degree (number of outgoing links) of node $i$. Connectedness, efficiency, hierarchy, and LUBedness were calculated as in ref. @krackhardt_graph_1994. GLBedness was calculated as the LUBedness of the transpose of the adjacency matrix; that is, the LUBedness of the map with all edges reversed. Pearson correlation coefficients are presented with markers for their asymptotic p-values. To correlate R/T with other variables, we defined finite values when there were no transmitter variables in the graph: When there were also no receiver variables we deemed $R/T = 1$, and when there were $R>0$ receiver variables and no transmitters, we deemed $R/T = R + 1$. In the correlation plot in supplementary materials variables are ordered by the angular order of the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.
